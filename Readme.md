# ALLUSION - A Reference image helper for artists

## Adding images
Add content to current artboard from a browser or file explorer:

- Copy-Paste image
- Drag and Drop image
- Adding by folder?

## Artboard 
- Contains all the images (and future scribble/notes)
- Contains "section" or pages to since no pan or zoom function exist (perhaps being able to quickly switch between section ?)
- Saves all the images to the artboard folder and keeps simple data of the image:
  - Source (url)
  - Notes
  - ?

## Images
- Can be rescaled and moved inside the artboard (aspect-ratio lock)
- Are saved to png no matter the source type (might change)
- Transparency isn't supported yet, not sure if it's even useful.
- Changing name of the image (?)

## Configuration (more or less a wish list)
- Hopefully theme
- Some hotkeys
- Perhaps default artboard folder
