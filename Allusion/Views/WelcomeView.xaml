            Allusion is a mood and reference image organizer designed with simplicity in mind. It comes with a simple user interface and straight forward interactions, to keep you
            focused on the essentials.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            With simplicity come certain limitations, and in the case of Allusion, it means there is no zoom or pan in the main view.
            This approach is based on my belief, drawn from experience, that maintaining a clean workspace can help keep the mind at ease.
            By limiting the number of images to what your monitor can comfortably display, you’re encouraged to organize your references thoughtfully,
            reducing visual clutter. Of course, if you’re using a particularly small monitor, adjustments may be necessary in the future.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            Create pages to organize your mood board and, if needed, add notes to your images for better clarity.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            A mood board should be something simple - a quick source of inspiration or a reminder of
            a specific concept or shape.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            Allusion is in its early stages, just like my journey in coding. I truly value feedback, so please feel free to share any suggestions.<LineBreak />
            <LineBreak />
            Take care!<LineBreak />
